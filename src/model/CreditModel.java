		"Even if my squaritude is a little too pronounced\n\n"+
		"Perhaps I do not strike you as a geek\n"+
		"Without the horn rimmed glasses and knee-high argyle socks\n"+
		"But nerdery is more than wardrobe deep\n"+
		"And I'm a nerd down in my heart and that's where nerdhood rocks\n\n"+
		"I'm better aquainted than a good girl aught to be\n"+
		"With Aragorn and Yo-Saf-Bridge and Warf and HAL and Han\n"+
		"But you don't really know me and my culture don't control me\n"+
		"So don't you pigeon hole me 'cause my phaser's set to stun!\n\n"+

		"And I don't mind being underrated or ignored\n"+
		"The world is much too interesting to entertain ennui\n"+
		"And I won't ever play it cool so I won't ever once be bored\n"+
		"Oh, I have been a nerd since before anyone heard\n"+
		"That pale and scrawny was the latest fashion trend\n"+
		"And I'll still be a geek after nobody thinks it's chic\n"+
		"Because I don't require approval in the end\n\n"+
		"In aught-four, D-Kwon's Dance Grooves swept the country\n"+
		"And suddenly old moon boots were Italian haute couture\n"+
		"Time magazine reported that our time had finally come\n"+
		"I guess they didn't know that we already run the world\n\n"+
		"I have been a nerd since my first five syllable word\n"+
		"And no TV series or movie changes that\n"+
		"And I'll still be a geek now 'Vote for Pedro's so last week\n"+
		"I do not care whether Milan endorses plaid\n\n"+
		"I have been a nerd since long before anyone heard\n"+
		"That thin and scrawny was the latest fashion trend\n"+
